To make .wav files from mp3 run 

> python peoplesounds/decode.py {path to base} 


To run training

> python peoplesounds/train.py {path to base}  {path to output}


I've been using "data/run.txt" for output. The code will append to the file. 

For training 

- 'y' is for voice
- 'n' is no voice
- 's' is to skip (half voice/half no-voice)
